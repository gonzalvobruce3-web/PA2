# PA — NumPy: Normalization & Divisible-by-3

Python Data Manipulation Assignment — **NumPy**

---

## Overview
This repo contains two short NumPy tasks that practice array creation, aggregation, reshaping, and boolean masking.

---

## Instructions
Write a Python script (or Jupyter notebook) to solve each problem. **Save the specified outputs** as `.npy` files.

---

## Problem 1: Normalization Problem

Normalization centers data by subtracting the mean and scales it by dividing by the standard deviation:

Z = (X - mean) / std

**Tasks**
- Create a random **5×5** ndarray and store it in `X`.
- Compute the overall mean (`X.mean()`) and std (`X.std()`).
- Normalize to `Z` using the formula above.
- **Save** the normalized array as **`X_normalized.npy`**.

# Divisible-by-3 Problem (NumPy)

Create a **10×10** ndarray `A` containing the squares of the first 100 positive integers (1² … 100²). From this array, determine **all elements divisible by 3** and save them to a file.
